      <h3>  Incorporated Privacy Policy</h3>

      <h6>Your privacy is important to us.</h6>
      <p>
        Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to
        explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our
        Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if
        they are accessible through our Services.
      </p>

      <h6>In this Privacy Policy:</h6>

      <ul>
        <li>We’ll refer to our website as the “Site”.</li>
        <li>We’ll refer to   Inc. as   or “we” or “us” or “our”.</li>
        <li>We’ll refer to all the products and services we provide individually and collectively, as the “Services”.</li>
        <li>We’ll refer to you, the person or entity accessing our Site or using our Services, as “you” or “your” or (if you are a purchaser of our Services, our “customer”).</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Some other definitions we’ll be using in this Privacy Policy</h6>

      <p>
        <strong>What is a Data Controller?</strong> For general data protection regulation purposes, the “Data
        Controller” means the organization who decides the purposes for which and the way in which any personal data is
        processed. Our customers are the Data Controllers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What is a Data Processor?</strong> A “Data Processor” is an organization which processes Personal
        Information for a Data Controller. We are the Data Processor for our customers. As a Data Processor, we are
        bound by the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (the “GDPR”).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What is Data Processing?</strong> Data processing is any operation or set of operations performed upon
        Personal Information (whether automated or not). Examples of data processing explicitly listed in the text of
        the GDPR are: collection, recording, organizing, structuring, storing, adapting, altering, retrieving,
        consulting, using, disclosing by transmission, disseminating or making available, aligning or combining,
        restricting, erasure or destruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What is Personal Information?</strong> Personal informatio is any information which is about you,
        from which you can be identified. Personal Information includes information such as an individual's name,
        address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal Information also includes information about an
        individual's activities, such as information about his or her activity on Site or our Services, and demographic
        information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is
        linked to personal information that identifies that individual. Personal Information does not include
        "aggregate" or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is information that we
        collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from
        which individual identities are removed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How do we collect Personal Information?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>In our service as a Data Processor, we collect Personal Information from Data Controllers in the followings ways:</p>

      </ul>

      <p>
        We may also receive information about you, including Personal Information, from third parties, and may combine
        this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Privacy Policy governs
        any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.
      </p>

        messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us regarding our Services.
      </p>

      <h6>Do we use cookies?</h6>

      <p>
        Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive
        through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you
        have a registered account, associate it with your registered account. We may use both session Cookies and
        persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact
        with our Site. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate
        data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the
        future. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to
        customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off
        from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change
        your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please
        note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the
        Site or the Services. We may also collect information via standard server logs or clear GIFs (also known as
        “Web beacons”). If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal
        Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we
        use information collected by passive means in non-personally identifiable form only.
      </p>

      <h6>Who at   may access your Personal Information?</h6>

      <p>
        Designated members of our staff may access Personal Information to help our customers with any questions they
        have, including help using the product, investigating security issues, or following up on bug fixes with the
        customer. This activity is logged in our system for compliance, and we maintain different levels of access for
        its employees depending on their role in our company.
      </p>

      <h6>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h6>

      <p>
        Except as set out below, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personal
        Information. Non-personally identifiable visitor information, however, may be provided to other parties for
        marketing, advertising, or other uses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Customers belong to organizations on   and may invite other team members. Team members will have
        access to the organization’s data (including Personal Information) that we process on behalf of the Data
        Controller. Each customer can designate team administrators who can control who has access to the Personal
        Information.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may disclose Personal Information to third-party service providers (for example, payment processing and
        data storage and processing facilities) that assist us in our work. We limit the Personal Information provided
        to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we
        require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such Personal Information.
        We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors.
        These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us
        conduct and improve our business.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may also release your Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law,
        enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your Personal Information may also be transferred to another company in the event of a transfer, change of
        ownership, reorganization or assignment of all or part of our businesses or assets. This will occur if the
        parties have entered into an agreement under which the collection, use and disclosure of the information is
        limited to those purposes of the business transaction, including a determination whether or not to proceed
        with the business transaction. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our websites for thirty
        (30) days of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal Information or as otherwise may be
        required or permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h6>How do we handle global transfers and process of your Personal Information?</h6>

      <p>
        Although we welcome people from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you
        happen to use our services, your Personal Information may be shared. This means that we may collect your
        Personal Information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries
        outside of where you live. For example, some of our third-party providers may be located in different countries.
        Where this is the case, we will take steps to make sure the right security measures are taken so that your
        privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy. By submitting your Personal
        Information, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If we transfer your Personal Information
        from the E.U. and process it in the United States, we do so in accordance with applicable law. With respect
        to information received or transferred, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal
        Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to
        lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
        We will not transfer your Personal Information outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) unless it takes
        such measures as are necessary to provide adequate protection for such Personal Information consistent with the
        requirements of applicable laws. To the extent that we process (or causes to be processed) any Personal
        Information originating from the EEA in a country that has not been designated by the European Commission as
        providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information, the Personal Information shall be deemed to
        have adequate protection (within the meaning of EU Data Protection Legislation) by virtue of the European
        Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries, whereby you will
        be regarded as the Data Exporter and we will be regarded as the Data Importer. In the event that the Contractual
        Clauses are deemed to no longer be a valid mechanism to legitimize transfers of personal data outside the
        European Economic Area, we will amend this Policy in order to establish a legitimate transfer of personal data
        outside the European Economic Area.
      </p>

      <h6>Principle of Onward Transfer</h6>

      <p>
        In the context of an onward transfer of data to a third party, we have responsibility for the processing of
        Personal Data we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We shall
        remain liable under applicable law if our agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with
        applicable law, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
      </p>

      <h6>Retention of your Personal Information</h6>

      <p>
        We retain your Personal Information for as long as we need to fulfill our Services. In addition:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We may keep data linked to cookies and other online identifiers up to three years.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we are involved in litigation or a governmental or regulatory investigation, then we keep data throughout
          the period of litigation or investigation and for 5 years after that. If a settlement means that we have
          to keep data for longer, then we keep data for the period required to administer the settlement. If we provide
          data to law enforcement agencies, then we keep a record of this for one year beyond the end of the
          investigation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Third-party Links</h6>

      <p>
        Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our Site. This
        Privacy Policy only applies to our Site, so when you link to other websites you should read those separate and
        independent privacy policies. We have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these
        linked sites. However, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
      </p>

      <h6>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h6>

      <p>
        Our Site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 18 years old or older. We strive to
        comply with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). If this server is in the
        United States, and you are under the age of 13, do not use this site. We do not knowingly collect Personal
        Information from children under the age of 18 or your country’s age of minority. If you nevertheless believe
        that your child has provided us with their Personal Information, please contact us and we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h6>Online Privacy Policy Only</h6>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through our site and not to information collected
        offline.
      </p>

      <h6>Your Consent</h6>

      <p>By using our site, you consent to this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h6>Your Rights</h6>

      <p>Other rights you have include the rights to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Ask for a copy of your Personal Information
          <ul>
            <li>
              This is known as a Subject Access Request. If you would like a copy of some or all of one of your user's
              Personal Information, please contact us as <strong>support@ .com</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Ask us to correct your Personal Information
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is your right to lodge an objection to the processing of your Personal Information if you believe that
              the legal ground “relating to your particular situation” applies.&nbsp; The only reasons we will be able
              to deny your request is if we can show compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override
